    <!-- here is all of the paragraph and images of research-->
    <p align="justify">Research is a method of collecting and analyzing information in order to enhance our knowledge of a subject or problem. "It comprises of three steps: asking a question, collecting data to answer the question and answering the question.Research helps us to gain knowledge and different  skills to do our projects or solve the problems.The project was all about the development of ecommerce websites. I was very new in web development and had only basic knowledge .So without research,this project cann't be done and it wasn't simple.Therefore, I've researched in many sites and web development books to effectively develop my project.I understood that a great deal of studies enables us to obtain information sources and will always draw us out of the difficulties. So here are some  research  I took during my project with the screenshots.
